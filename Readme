Hi all, This project is about the quality analysis of the skull stripping tools that we use in medical Image Processing.

Introduction

We have used images from the link 

Developed an Algorithm than can classify whether the skull around the brain is stripped efficiently or not.
Convoluted using CNN3D layers , Adam optimizer for efficiency and F1-score to deal with class imbalance.
